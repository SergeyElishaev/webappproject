  <h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

  <p>In re-editing the present romance-poem I have been saved all labour of
  transcription by using the very accurate text contained in Sir F.
  Madden's "Syr Gawayne."</p>

  <p>I have not only read his copy with the manuscript, but also the
  proof-sheets as they came to hand, hoping by this means to give the
  reader a text free from any errors of transcription.</p>

  <p>The present edition differs from that of the earlier one in having the
  contractions of the manuscript expanded and side-notes added to the text
  to enable the reader to follow with some degree of ease the author's
  pleasant narrative of Sir Gawayne's adventures.</p>

  <p>The Glossary is taken from Sir F. Madden's "Syr Gawayne,"<sup>1</sup> to which,
  for the better interpretation of the text, I have made several additions,
  and have, moreover, glossed nearly all the words previously left
  unexplained.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

  <p>No Knight of the Round Table has been so highly honoured by the old
  Romance-writers as Sir Gawayne, the son of Loth, and nephew to the
  renowned Arthur. They delighted to describe him as Gawayne the good, a
  man matchless on mould, the most gracious that under God lived, the
  hardiest of hand, the most fortunate in arms, and the most polite in
  hall, whose knowledge, knighthood, kindly works, doings, doughtiness, and
  deeds of arms were known in all lands.</p>

  <p>When Arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground
  bathed in blood, he is said to have exclaimed, "O righteous God, this
  blood were worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold!" Our author,
  too, loves to speak of his hero in similar terms of praise, calling him
  the knight faultless in his five wits, void of every offence, and adorned
  with every earthly virtue. He represents him as one whose trust was in
  the five wounds, and in whom the five virtues which distinguished the
  true knight were more firmly established than in any other on earth.</p>

  <p>The author of the present story, who, as we know from his religious
  poems, had an utter horror of moral impurity, could have chosen no better
  subject for a romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be
  combined. In the following tale he shows how the true knight, though
  tempted sorely not once alone, but twice, nay thrice, breaks not his vow
  of chastity, but turns aside the tempter's shafts with the shield of
  purity and arm of faith, and so passes scatheless through the perilous
  defile of trial and opportunity seeming safe.</p>

  <p>But while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story
  from the "Roman de Perceval" by Chrestien de Troyes, he has made the
  narrative more attractive by the introduction of several original and
  highly interesting passages which throw light on the manners and
  amusements of our ancestors.</p>

  <p>The following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial
  notice:—</p>

  <blockquote>I. The mode of completely arming a knight (ll.
  568-589).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>II. The hunting and breaking the deer (ll.
  1126-1359).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>III. The hunting and unlacing the wild boar (ll.
  1412-1614).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>IV. A fox hunt (ll. 1675-1921).</blockquote>

  <p>The following is an outline of the story of Gawayne's adventures, more
  or less in the words of the writer himself:—</p>

  <blockquote>Arthur, the greatest of Britain's kings, holds the Christmas
  festival at Camelot, surrounded by the celebrated knights of the Round
  Table, noble lords, the most renowned under heaven, and ladies the
  loveliest that ever had life (ll. 37-57). This noble company celebrate
  the New Year by a religious service, by the bestowal of gifts, and the
  most joyous mirth. Lords and ladies take their seats at the
  table—Queen Guenever, the grey-eyed, gaily dressed, sits at the
  daïs, the high table, or table of state, where too sat Gawayne and Ywain
  together with other worthies of the Round Table (ll. 58-84, 107-115).
  Arthur, in mood as joyful as a child, his blood young and his brain wild,
  declares that he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some
  adventurous thing, some uncouth tale, some great marvel, or some
  encounter of arms has occurred to mark the return of the New Year (ll.
  85-106).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The first course was announced with cracking of trumpets,
  with the noise of nakers and noble pipes.</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"Each two had dishes twelve,</p>
      <p class="i4">Good beer and bright wine both."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>Scarcely was the first course served when another noise than
  that of music was heard. There rushes in at the hall-door a knight of
  gigantic stature—the greatest on earth—in measure high. He
  was clothed entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178).
  Fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the Green Knight, and a great
  beard like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one
  hand a holly bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge
  of which was as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). Thus arrayed, the
  Green Knight enters the hall without saluting any one. The first word
  that he uttered was, "Where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would I
  see him and with himself speak reason." To the knights he cast his eye,
  looking for the most renowned. Much did the noble assembly marvel to see
  a man and a horse of such a hue, green as the grass. Even greener they
  seemed than green enamel on bright gold. Many marvels had they seen, but
  none such as this. They were afraid to answer, but sat stone-still in a
  dead silence, as if overpowered by sleep;</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"Not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>Then Arthur before the high daïs salutes the Green Knight,
  bids him welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his Court. The
  knight says that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek
  the most valiant of the heroes of the Round Table that he may put his
  courage to the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of Arthur's
  court. "I come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that I
  bear here. Had I come with hostile intentions, I should not have left my
  hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, and other weapons behind me. But
  because I desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' If thou be so bold as all
  men say, thou wilt grant me the request I am about to make." "Sir
  courteous knight," replies Arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
  failest thou not to fight." "Nay," says the Green Knight, "I seek no
  fighting. Here about on this bench are only beardless children. Were I
  arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me (ll.
  250-282). But it is now Christmas time, and this is the New Year, and I
  see around me many brave ones;—if any be so bold in his blood that
  dare strike a stroke for another, I shall give him this rich axe to do
  with it whatever he pleases. I shall abide the first blow just as I sit,
  and will stand him a stroke, stiff on this floor, provided that I deal
  him another in return.</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">And yet give I him respite,</p>
      <p class="i4">A twelvemonth and a day;</p>
      <p class="i4">Now haste and let see tite (soon)</p>
      <p class="i4">Dare any here-in ought say.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>If he astounded them at first, much more so did he after this
  speech, and fear held them all silent. The knight, righting himself in
  his saddle, rolls fiercely his red eyes about, bends his bristly green
  brows, and strokes his beard awaiting a reply. But finding none that
  would carp with him, he exclaims, "What! is this Arthur's house, the fame
  of which has spread through so many realms? Forsooth, the renown of the
  Round Table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for all
  tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). With this
  he laughed so loud that Arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed as wroth
  as the wind. "I know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy great
  words. Give me now thy axe and I will grant thee thy request!" Arthur
  seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it about, while
  the Green Knight, with a stern cheer and a dry countenance, stroking his
  beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the blow (ll. 314-335). Sir
  Gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his uncle to let him undertake
  the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty of his nobles, Arthur
  consents "to give Gawayne the game" (ll. 336-365).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Sir Gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the
  blow is dealt, the Green Knight asks the name of his opponent. "In good
  faith," answers the good knight, "Gawayne I am called, that bids thee to
  this buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
  take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no wight
  else alive." "By Gog," quoth the Green Knight, "it pleases me well that I
  shall receive at thy fist that which I have sought here—moreover
  thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant,—but thou shalt
  first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek me thyself, wheresoever on
  earth thou believest I may be found, and fetch thee such wages as thou
  dealest me to-day before this company of doughty ones." "Where should I
  seek thee?" replies Gawayne, "where is thy place? I know not thee, thy
  court, or thy name. I wot not where thou dwellest, but teach me thereto,
  tell me how thou art called, and I shall endeavour to find
  thee,—and that I swear thee for truth and by my sure troth." "That
  is enough in New Year," says the groom in green, "if I tell thee when I
  have received the tap. When thou hast smitten me, then smartly I will
  teach thee of my house, my home, and my own name, so that thou mayest
  follow my track and fulfil the covenant between us. If I spend no speech,
  then speedest thou the better, for then mayest thou remain in thy own
  land and seek no further; but cease thy talking<sup>1</sup> (ll. 366-412). Take
  now thy grim tool to thee and let us see how thou knockest." "Gladly,
  sir, for sooth," quoth Gawayne, and his axe he brandishes.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>[<sup>1</sup> This, I think, is the true explanation of
  <i>slokes</i>.]</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The Green Knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends
  slightly his head, lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays
  bare his neck for the blow. Gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it
  on high, let it fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head
  from the body. The fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many
  turned it aside with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood burst from
  the body, yet the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he started
  forth on stiff shanks and fiercely rushed forward, seized his head, and
  lifted it up quickly. Then he runs to his horse, the bridle he catches,
  steps into his stirrups and strides aloft. His head by the hair he holds
  in his hands, and sits as firmly in his saddle as if no mishap had ailed
  him, though headless he was (ll. 413-439). He turned his ugly trunk
  about—that ugly body that bled,—and holding the head in his
  hand, he directed the face toward the "dearest on the dais." The head
  lifted up its eyelids and looked abroad, and thus much spoke with its
  mouth as ye may now hear:</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Loke, Gawayne, thou be prompt to go as thou hast promised,
  and seek till thou find me according to thy promise made in the hearing
  of these knights. Get thee to the Green Chapel, I charge thee, to fetch
  such a dint as thou hast dealt, to be returned on New Year's morn. As the
  Knight of the Green Chapel I am known to many, wherefore if thou seekest
  thou canst not fail to find me. Therefore come, or recreant be called."
  With a fierce start the reins he turns, rushes out of the hall-door, his
  head in his hand, so that the fire of the flint flew from the hoofs of
  his foal. To what kingdom he belonged knew none there, nor knew they from
  whence he had come. What then?</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"The king and Gawayne there</p>
      <p class="i4">At that green (one) they laugh and grin."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>Though Arthur wondered much at the marvel, he let no one see
  that he was at all troubled about it, but full loudly thus spake to his
  comely queen with courteous speech:</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Dear dame, to-day be never dismayed, well happens such craft
  at Christmas time. I may now proceed to meat, for I cannot deny that I
  have witnessed a wondrous adventure this day" (ll. 440-475).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>He looked upon Sir Gawayne and said, "Now, sir, hang up thine
  axe, for enough has it hewn." So the weapon was hung up on high that all
  might look upon it, and "by true title thereof tell the wonder." Then all
  the knights hastened to their seats at the table, so did the king and our
  good knight, and they were there served with all dainties, "with all
  manner of meat and minstrelsy."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Though words were wanting when they first to seat went, now
  are their hands full of stern work, and the marvel affords them good
  subject for conversation. But a year passes full quickly and never
  returns,—the beginning is seldom like the end; wherefore this
  Christmas passed away and the year after, and each season in turn
  followed after another (ll. 476-520). Thus winter winds round again, and
  then Gawayne thinks of his wearisome journey (ll. 521-535). On
  All-hallows day Arthur entertains right nobly the lords and ladies of his
  court in honour of his nephew, for whom all courteous knights and lovely
  ladies were in great grief. Nevertheless they spoke only of mirth, and,
  though joyless themselves, made many a joke to cheer the good Sir Gawayne
  (ll. 536-565). Early on the morrow Sir Gawayne, with great ceremony, is
  arrayed in his armour (ll. 566-589), and thus completely equipped for his
  adventure he first hears mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur, the
  knights of the Round Table, and the lords and ladies of the court, who
  kiss him and commend him to Christ. He bids them all good day, as he
  thought, for evermore (ll. 590-669);</blockquote>

      <p class="i4">"<i>Very much was the warm water that poured from eyes that day</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>Now rides our knight through the realms of England with no
  companion but his foal, and no one to hold converse with save God alone.
  From Camelot, in Somersetshire, he proceeds through Gloucestershire and
  the adjoining counties into Montgomeryshire, and thence through North
  Wales to Holyhead, adjoining the Isle of Anglesea (ll. 670-700), from
  which he passes into the very narrow peninsula  of Wirral, in Cheshire,
  where dwelt but few that loved God or man. Gawayne enquires after the
  Green Knight of the Green Chapel, but all the inhabitants declare that
  they have never seen "any man of such hues of green."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The knight thence pursues his journey by strange paths, over
  hill and moor, encountering on his way not only serpents, wolves, bulls,
  bears, and boars, but wood satyrs and giants. But worse than all those,
  however, was the sharp winter, "when the cold clear water shed from the
  clouds, and froze ere it might fall to the earth. Nearly slain with the
  sleet he slept in his armour, more nights than enough, in naked rocks"
  (ll. 701-729).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Thus in peril and plight the knight travels on until
  Christmas-eve, and to Mary he makes his moan that she may direct him to
  some abode. On the morn he arrives at an immense forest, wondrously wild,
  surrounded by high hills on every side, where he found hoary oaks full
  huge, a hundred together. The hazel and the hawthorn intermingled were
  all overgrown with moss, and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that
  piteously piped for pain of the cold. Gawayne besought the Lord and Mary
  to guide him to some habitation where he might hear mass (ll. 730-762).
  Scarcely had he crossed himself thrice, when he perceived a dwelling in
  the wood set upon a hill. It was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld.
  It was pitched on a prairie, with a park all about it, enclosing many a
  tree for more than two miles. It shone as the sun through the bright oaks
  (ll. 763-772).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne urges on his steed Gringolet, and finds himself at
  the "chief gate." He called aloud, and soon there appeared a "porter" on
  the wall, who demanded his errand.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Good sir," quoth Gawayne, "wouldst thou go to the high lord
  of this house, and crave a lodging for me?"</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Yea, by Peter!" replied the porter, "well I know that thou
  art welcome to dwell here as long as thou likest."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The drawbridge is soon let down, and the gates opened wide to
  receive the knight. Many noble ones hasten to bid him welcome (ll.
  773-825). They take away his helmet, sword, and shield, and many a proud
  one presses forward to do him honour. They bring him into the hall, where
  a fire was brightly burning upon the hearth. Then the lord of the land<sup>1</sup>
  comes from his chamber and welcomes Sir Gawayne, telling him that he is
  to consider the place as his own. Our knight is next conducted to a
  bright bower, where was noble bedding—curtains of pure silk, with
  golden hems, and Tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the floors (ll.
  826-859). Here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes, which
  so well became him, that all declared that a more comely knight Christ
  had never made (ll. 860-883).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>[<sup>1</sup> Gawayne is now in the castle of the Green
  Knight, who, divested of his elvish or supernatural character, appears to
  our knight merely as a bold one with a beaver-hued beard.]</blockquote>

  <blockquote>A table is soon raised, and Gawayne, having washed, proceeds
  to meat. Many dishes are set before him—"sews" of various kinds,
  fish of all kinds, some baked in bread, others broiled on the embers,
  some boiled, and others seasoned with spices. The knight expresses
  himself well pleased, and calls it a most noble and princely
  feast.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>After dinner, in reply to numerous questions, he tells his
  host that he is Gawayne, one of the Knights of the Round Table. When this
  was made known great was the joy in the hall. Each one said softly to his
  companion, "Now we shall see courteous behaviour and learn the terms of
  noble discourse, since we have amongst us 'that fine father of nurture.'
  Truly God has highly favoured us in sending us such a noble guest as Sir
  Gawayne" (ll. 884-927). At the end of the Christmas festival Gawayne
  desires to take his departure from the castle, but his host persuades him
  to stay, promising to direct him to the Green Chapel (about two miles
  from the castle), that he may be there by the appointed time (ll.
  1029-1082).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>A covenant is made between them, the terms of which were that
  the lord of the castle should go out early to the chase, that Gawayne
  meanwhile should lie in his loft at his ease, then rise at his usual
  hour, and afterwards sit at table with his hostess, and that at the end
  of the day they should make an exchange of whatever they might obtain in
  the interim. "Whatever I win in the wood," says the lord, "shall be
  yours, and what thou gettest shall be mine" (ll. 1083-1125).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Full early before daybreak the folk uprise, saddle their
  horses, and truss their mails. The noble lord of the land, arrayed for
  riding, eats hastily a sop, and having heard mass, proceeds with a
  hundred hunters to hunt the wild deer (ll. 1126-1177).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>All this time Gawayne lies in his gay bed. His nap is
  disturbed by a little noise at the door, which is softly opened. He
  heaves up his head out of the clothes, and, peeping through the curtains,
  beholds a most lovely lady (the wife of his host). She came towards the
  bed, and the knight laid himself down quickly, pretending to be asleep.
  The lady stole to the bed, cast up the curtains, crept within, sat her
  softly on the bed-side, and waited some time till the knight should
  awake. After lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all
  meant, Gawayne unlocked his eyelids, and put on a look of surprise, at
  the same time making the sign of the cross, as if afraid of some hidden
  danger (ll. 1178-1207). "Good morrow, sir," said that fair lady, "ye are
  a careless sleeper to let one enter thus. I shall bind you in your bed,
  of that be ye sure." "Good morrow," quoth Gawayne, "I shall act according
  to your will with great pleasure, but permit me to rise that I may the
  more comfortably converse with you." "Nay, beau sir," said that sweet
  one, "ye shall not rise from your bed, for since I have caught my knight
  I shall hold talk with him. I ween well that ye are Sir Gawayne that all
  the world worships, whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised. Now
  ye are here, and we are alone (my lord and his men being afar off, other
  men, too, are in bed, so are my maidens), and the door is safely closed,
  I shall use my time well while it lasts. Ye are welcome to my person to
  do with it as ye please, and I will be your servant" (ll.
  1208-1240).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne behaves most discreetly, for the remembrance of his
  forthcoming adventure at the Green Chapel prevents him from thinking of
  love (ll. 1205-1289). At last the lady takes leave of the knight by
  catching him in her arms and kissing him (ll. 1290-1307). The day passes
  away merrily, and at dusk the Lord of the castle returns from the chase.
  He presents the venison to Gawayne according to the previous covenant
  between them. Our knight gives his host a kiss as the only piece of good
  fortune that had fallen to him during the day. "It is good," says the
  other, "and would be much better if ye would tell me where ye won such
  bliss" (ll. 1308-1394). "That was not in our covenant," replies Gawayne,
  "so try me no more." After much laughing on both sides they proceed to
  supper, and afterwards, while the choice wine is being carried round,
  Gawayne and his host renew their agreement. Late at night they take leave
  of each other and hasten to their beds. "By the time that the cock had
  crowed and cackled thrice" the lord was up, and after "meat and mass"
  were over the hunters make for the woods, where they give chase to a wild
  boar who had grown old and mischievous (ll. 1395-1467).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>While the sportsmen are hunting this "wild swine" our lovely
  knight lies in his bed. He is not forgotten by the lady, who pays him an
  early visit, seeking to make further trial of his virtues. She sits
  softly by his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught
  him the day before (ll. 1468-1486). "I taught you of kissing," says she;
  "that becomes every courteous knight." Gawayne says that he must not take
  that which is forbidden him. The lady replies that he is strong enough to
  enforce his own wishes. Our knight answers that every gift not given with
  a good will is worthless. His fair visitor then enquires how it is that
  he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned a knight,
  has never talked to her of love (ll. 1487-1524). "You ought," she says,
  "to show and teach a young thing like me some tokens of true-love's
  crafts; I come hither and sit here alone to learn of you some game; do
  teach me of your wit while my lord is from home." Gawayne replies that he
  cannot undertake the task of expounding true-love and tales of arms to
  one who has far more wisdom than he possesses. Thus did our knight avoid
  all appearance of evil, though sorely pressed to do what was wrong (ll.
  1525-1552). The lady, having bestowed two kisses upon Sir Gawayne, takes
  her leave of him (ll. 1553-1557).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>At the end of the day the lord of the castle returns home
  with the shields and head of the wild boar. He shows them to his guest,
  who declares that "such a brawn of a beast, nor such sides of a swine,"
  he never before has seen. Gawayne takes possession of the spoil according
  to covenant, and in return he bestows two kisses upon his host, who
  declares that his guest has indeed been rich with "such chaffer" (ll.
  1558-1647).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>After much persuasion, Gawayne consents to stop at the castle
  another day (ll. 1648-1685). Early on the morrow the lord and his men
  hasten to the woods, and come upon the track of a fox, the hunting of
  which affords them plenty of employment and sport (ll. 1686-1730).
  Meanwhile our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains. He
  is again visited by the lady of the castle. So gaily was she attired, and
  so "faultless of her features," that great joy warmed the heart of Sir
  Gawayne. With soft and pleasant smiles "they smite into mirth," and are
  soon engaged in conversation. Had not Mary thought of her knight, he
  would have been in great peril (ll. 1731-1769). So sorely does the fair
  one press him with her love, that he fears lest he should become a
  traitor to his host. The lady enquires whether he has a mistress to whom
  he has plighted his troth. The knight swears by St John that he neither
  has nor desires one. This answer causes the dame to sigh for sorrow, and
  telling him that she must depart, she asks for some gift, if it were only
  a glove, by which she might "think on the knight and lessen her grief"
  (ll. 1770-1800). Gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy of her
  acceptance; that he is on an "uncouth errand," and therefore has "no men
  with no mails containing precious things," for which he is truly
  sorry.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Quoth that lovesome (one)—</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"Though I had nought of yours,</p>
      <p class="i4"> Yet should ye have of mine.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>Thus saying, she offers him a rich ring of red gold "with a
  shining stone standing aloft," that shone like the beams of the bright
  sun. The knight refused the gift, as he had nothing to give in return.
  "Since ye refuse my ring," says the lady, "because it seems too rich, and
  ye would not be beholden to me, I shall give you my girdle that is less
  valuable" (ll. 1801-1835). But Gawayne replies that he will not accept
  gold or reward of any kind, though "ever in hot and in cold" he will be
  her true servant.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Do ye refuse it," asks the lady, "because it seems simple
  and of little value? Whoso knew the virtues that are knit therein would
  estimate it more highly. For he who is girded with this green lace cannot
  be wounded or slain by any man under heaven." The knight thinks awhile,
  and it strikes him that this would be a "jewel for the jeopardy" that he
  had to undergo at the Green Chapel. So he not only accepts the lace, but
  promises to keep the possession of it a secret (ll. 1836-1865). By that
  time the lady had kissed him thrice, and she then takes "her leave and
  leaves him there."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne rises, dresses himself in noble array, and conceals
  the "love lace" where he might find it again. He then hies to mass,
  shrives him of his misdeeds, and obtains absolution. On his return to the
  hall he solaces the ladies with comely carols and all kinds of joy (ll.
  1866-1892). The dark night came, and then the lord of the castle, having
  slain the fox, returns to his "dear home," where he finds a fire brightly
  turning and his guest amusing the ladies (ll. 1893-1927). Gawayne, in
  fulfilment of his agreement, kisses his host thrice.<sup>1</sup> "By Christ,"
  quoth the other knight, "ye have caught much bliss. I have hunted all
  this day and nought have I got but the skin of this foul fox (the devil
  have the goods!), and that is full poor for to pay for such precious
  things" (ll. 1928-1951).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>After the usual evening's entertainment, Gawayne retires to
  rest. The next morning, being New Year's day, is cold and stormy. Snow
  falls, and the dales are full of drift. Our knight in his bed locks his
  eyelids, but full little he sleeps. By each cock that crows he knows the
  hour, and before day-break he calls for his chamberlain, who quickly
  brings him his armour (ll. 1952-2014). While Gawayne clothed himself in
  his rich weeds he forgot not the "lace, the lady's gift," but with it
  doubly girded his loins. He wore it not for its rich ornaments, "but to
  save himself when it behoved him to suffer," and as a safeguard against
  sword or knife (ll. 2015-2046).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Having thanked his host and all the renowned assembly for the
  great kindness he had experienced at their hands, "he steps into stirrups
  and strides aloft" (ll. 2047-2068).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The drawbridge is let down, and the broad gates unbarred and
  borne open upon both sides, and the knight, after commending the castle
  to Christ, passes thereout and goes on his way accompanied by his guide,
  that should teach him to turn to that place where he should receive the
  much-dreaded blow. They climb over cliffs, where each hill had a hat and
  a mist-cloak, until the next morn, when they find themselves on a full
  high hill covered with snow. The servant bids his master remain awhile,
  saying, "I have brought you hither at this time, and now ye are not far
  from that noted place that ye have so often enquired after. The place
  that ye press to is esteemed full perilous, and there dwells a man in
  that waste the worst upon earth, for he is stiff and stern and loves to
  strike, and greater is he than any man upon middle-earth, and his body is
  bigger than the best four in Arthur's house. He keeps the Green Chapel;
  there passes none by that place, however proud in arms, that he does not
  'ding him to death with dint of his hand.' He is a man immoderate and 'no
  mercy uses,' for be it churl or chaplain that by the chapel rides, monk
  or mass-priest, or any man else, it is as pleasant to him to kill them as
  to go alive himself. Wherefore I tell thee truly, 'come ye there, ye be
  killed, though ye had twenty lives to spend. He has dwelt there long of
  yore, and on field much sorrow has wrought. Against his sore dints ye may
  not defend you' (ll. 2069-2117). Therefore, good Sir Gawayne, let the man
  alone, and for God's sake go by some other path, and then I shall hie me
  home again. I swear to you by</blockquote>

  <blockquote>[<sup>1</sup> He only in part keeps to his covenant, as he
  holds back the <i>love-lace</i>.]</blockquote>

  <blockquote>God and all His saints that I will never say that ever ye
  attempted to flee from any man."	</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne thanks his guide for his well-meant kindness, but
  declares that to the Green Chapel he will go, though the owner thereof be
  "a stern knave," for God can devise means to save his
  servants.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Mary!" quoth the other, "since it pleases thee to lose thy
  life I will not hinder thee. Have thy helmet on thy head, thy spear in
  thy hand, and ride down this path by yon rock-side, till thou be brought
  to the bottom of the valley. Then look a little on the plain, on thy left
  hand, and thou shalt see in that slade the chapel itself, and the burly
  knight that guards it (ll. 2118-2148). Now, farewell Gawayne the noble!
  for all the gold upon ground I would not go with thee nor bear thee
  fellowship through this wood 'on foot farther.'" Thus having spoken, he
  gallops away and leaves the knight alone.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne now pursues his journey, rides through the dale, and
  looks about. He sees no signs of a resting-place, but only high and steep
  banks, and the very shadows of the high woods seemed wild and distorted.
  No chapel, however, could he discover. After a while he sees a round hill
  by the side of a stream; thither he goes, alights, and fastens his horse
  to the branch of a tree. He walks about the hill, debating with himself
  what it might be. It had a hole in the one end and on each side, and
  everywhere overgrown with grass, but whether it was only an old cave or a
  crevice of an old crag he could not tell (ll. 2149-2188).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Now, indeed," quoth Gawayne, "a desert is here; this oratory
  is ugly with herbs overgrown. It is a fitting place for the man in green
  to 'deal here his devotions after the devil's manner.' Now I feel it is
  the fiend (the devil) in my five wits that has covenanted with me that he
  may destroy me. This is a chapel of misfortune—evil betide it! It
  is the most cursed kirk that ever I came in." With his helmet on his
  head, and spear in his hand, he roams up to the rock, and then he hears
  from that high hill beyond the brook a wondrous wild noise. Lo! it
  clattered in the cliff as if one upon a grindstone were grinding a
  scythe. It whirred like the water at a mill, and rushed and re-echoed,
  terrible to hear. "Though my life I forgo," says Gawayne, "no noise shall
  cause me to fear."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Then he cried aloud, "Who dwells in this place, discourse
  with me to hold? For now is good Gawayne going right here if any brave
  wight will hie him hither, either now or never" (ll.
  2189-2216).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Abide," quoth one on the bank above, over his head, "and
  thou shalt have all in haste that I promised thee once."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Soon there comes out of a hole in the crag, with a fell
  weapon a Danish axe quite new, the "man in the green," clothed as at
  first as his legs, locks and beard. But now he is on foot and walks on
  the earth. When he reaches the stream, he hops over and boldly strides
  about. He meets Sir Gawayne, who tells him that he is quite ready to
  fulfil his part of the compact. "Gawayne," quoth that 'green gome' (man),
  "may God preserve thee! Truly thou art welcome to my place, 'and thou
  hast timed thy travel' as a true man should. Thou knowest the covenants
  made between us, at this time twelve-month, that on New Year's day I
  should return thee thy blow. We are now in this valley by ourselves, and
  can do as we please (ll. 2217-2246). Have, therefore, thy helmet off thy
  head, and 'have here thy pay.' Let us have no more talk than when thou
  didst strike off my head with a single blow."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Nay, by God!" quoth Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy
  will for any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou
  strikest."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by
  any fear. The Green Knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his
  force raises it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. As the axe
  came gliding down Gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the
  sharp iron." The other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince
  with many proud words. "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed,
  that never feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest
  for fear before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). Such cowardice of that
  knight did I never hear. I never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim at
  me in King Arthur's house. My head flew to my feet and yet I never fled,
  wherefore I deserve to be called the better man."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Quoth Gawayne, "I shunted once, but will do so no more,
  though my head fall on the stones. But hasten and bring me to the point;
  deal me my destiny, and do it out of hand, for I shall stand thee a
  stroke and start no more until thine axe has hit me—have here my
  troth." "Have at thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft,
  and looks as savagely as if he were mad. He aims at the other mightily,
  but withholds his hand ere it might hurt. Gawayne readily abides the blow
  without flinching with any member, and stood still as a stone or a tree
  fixed in rocky ground with a hundred roots.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Then merrily the other did speak, "Since now thou hast thy
  heart whole it behoves me to strike, so take care of thy neck." Gawayne
  answers with great wroth, "Thrash on, thou fierce man, thou threatenest
  too long; I believe thy own heart fails thee."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Forsooth," quoth the other, "since thou speakest so boldly,
  I will no longer delay" (ll. 2273-2304). Then, contracting "both lips and
  brow," he made ready to strike, and let fall his axe on the bare neck of
  Sir Gawayne. "Though he hammered" fiercely, he only "severed the hide,"
  causing the blood to flow. When Gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
  quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. Then he drew out his
  bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "Cease, man, of thy blow, bid me no
  more. I have received a stroke in this place without opposition, but if
  thou givest me any more readily shall I requite thee, of that be thou
  sure. Our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now
  cease."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The Green Knight, resting on his axe, looks on Sir Gawayne,
  as bold and fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus
  addresses the knight: "Bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has
  wronged thee (ll. 2305-2339); I promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it,
  so hold thee well pleased. I could have dealt much worse with thee, and
  caused thee much sorrow. Two blows I aimed at thee, for twice thou
  kissedst my fair wife; but I struck thee not, because thou restoredst
  them to me according to agreement. At the third time thou failedst, and
  therefore I have given thee that tap. That woven girdle, given thee by my
  own wife, belongs to me. I know well thy kisses, thy conduct also, and
  the wooing of my wife, for I wrought it myself. I sent her to try thee,
  and truly methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot
  went. Still, sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded
  from no immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less
  I blame thee."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and
  he shrank within himself for very shame. "Cursed," he cried, "be
  cowardice and covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue
  destroy." Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in
  green, cursing his cowardice and covetousness. The Green Knight,
  laughing, thus spoke: "Thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy
  faults, that I hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou
  wast first born. I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of
  thy adventure at the Green Chapel. Come now to my castle, and we shall
  enjoy together the festivities of the New Year" (ll.
  2340-2406).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may
  God requite you. Commend me to that courteous one your comely wife, who
  with her crafts has beguiled me. But it is no uncommon thing for a man to
  come to sorrow through women's wiles; for so was Adam beguiled with one,
  and Solomon with many. Samson was destroyed by Delilah, and David
  suffered much through Bathsheba. <i>'It were indeed great bliss for a man
  to love them well and believe them not.'</i> Since the greatest upon
  earth were so beguiled, methinks I should be excused. But God reward you
  for your girdle, which I will ever wear in remembrance of my fault, and
  when pride shall exalt me, a look to this love-lace shall lessen it (ll.
  2407-2438). But since ye are the lord of yonder land, from whom I have
  received so much honour, tell me truly your right name, and I shall ask
  no more questions."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Quoth the other, "I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through
  might of Morgain la Fay, who dwells in my house. Much has she learnt of
  Merlin, who knows all your knights at home. She brought me to your hall
  for to essay the prowess of the Round Table. She wrought this wonder to
  bereave you of your wits, hoping to have grieved Guenever and affrighted
  her to death by means of the man that spoke with his head in his hand
  before the high table. She is even thine aunt, Arthur's half sister;
  wherefore come to thine aunt, for all my household love
  thee."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Gawayne refuses to accompany the Green Knight, and so, with
  many embraces and kind wishes, they separate—the one to his castle,
  the other to Arthur's court.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>After passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers
  from the wound in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court
  of King Arthur. Great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss
  their brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. He tells
  them of his adventures, hiding nothing—"the chance of the chapel,
  the cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
  Groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which he
  had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). The king and his
  courtiers comfort the knight—they laugh loudly at his adventures,
  and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the
  Round Table, and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear a
  bright green belt for Gawayne's sake. And he upon whom it was conferred
  honoured it evermore after.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Thus in Arthur's time this adventure befell, whereof the
  "Brutus Books" bear witness (ll. 2505-2530).</blockquote>

  <p>I need not say that the <i>Brutus Books</i> we possess do not contain
  the legend here set forth, though it is not much more improbable than
  some of the statements contained in them. If the reader desires to know
  the relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original
  Arthur legends, he will find it discussed in Sir F. Madden's Preface to
  his edition of "Syr Gawayne," which also contains a sketch of the very
  different views taken of Sir Gawayne by the different Romance
  writers.</p>

  <p>Into this and other <i>literary</i> questions I do not enter here, as
  I have nothing to add to Sir F. Madden's statements; but in the text of
  the Poem I have differed from him in some few readings, which will be
  found noticed in the Notes and Glossary.</p>

  <p>As the manuscript is fast fading, I am glad that the existence of the
  Early English Text Society has enabled us to secure a wider diffusion of
  its contents before the original shall be no longer legible.</p>

  <p>We want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to
  give to a large circle of readers many an equally interesting record of
  Early English minds.</p>

  <i>Camalot</i>, in Malory's "Morte Arthure," is said to be the same as
  Winchester. Ritson supposes it to be <i>Caer-went</i>, in Monmouthshire,
  and afterwards confounded with <i>Caer-wynt</i>, or <i>Winchester</i>.
  But popular tradition here seems the best guide, which assigned the site
  of Camalot to the ruins of a castle on a hill, near the church of South

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all were fallen asleep so ceased their words<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in haste (suddenly).<br>

  Sir F. Madden reads <i>slaked horlote&#541;</i>, instead of <i>slaked hor
  lote&#541;</i>, which, according to his glossary, signifies drunken vagabonds.
  He evidently takes <i>horlote&#541;</i> to be another (and a very uncommon)
  form of <i>harlote&#541;</i> = <i>harlots</i>. But <i>harlot</i>, or vagabond, would
  be a very inappropriate term to apply to the noble <i>Knights of the
  Round Table</i>. Moreover, <i>slaked</i> never, I think, means drunken.
  The general sense of the verb <i>slake</i> is to let loose, lessen,
  cease. Cf. lines 411-2, where <i>sloke</i>, another form of <i>slake</i>,
  occurs with a similar meaning:<br>      
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— <i>layt no fyrre; bot slokes</i>.<br>      
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— seek no further, but stop (cease).<br>  
  Sir F. Madden suggests <i>blows</i> as the explanation of
  <i>slokes</i>. It is, however, a <i>verb</i> in the imperative mood.</td></tr>

  The <i>gorger</i> or <i>wimple</i> is stated first to have appeared in
  Edward the First's reign, and an example is found on the monument of
  Aveline, Countess of Lancaster, who died in 1269. From the poem, however,
